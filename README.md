# Exploratory Data Analysis of H-1B Visa

## Introduction

The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the 
United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, an US employer must offer a job and 
petition for H-1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status 
applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, 
PhD) and work in a full-time position.

## Conclusion

The only numerical variable directly available in this dataset is PREVAILING_WAGE, so decided to put more effort in analyzing the wages amongst H1B workers, based on different groups. After getting histogram of wages,noticed that the huge amount of data combined with the existence of extremely large values slow down the process. One of the biggest limitations is that the dataset lacks of the academic background of H1B workers. Some achieved their university degrees in the US, while others hold their university degrees in their home countries. Some followed the career paths guided by what they learned from school, while others made a career transition after graduation. These are important information features that could help conduct drill-down analysis in terms of US employersâ€™ preference for US universities or STEM majors.
